        <p><b>Number of Websites I've Developed/Designed:</b> 16 (and counting)</p>
        <p>Troy Web Consulting is a Custom Web and Mobile Application shop based in Troy, NY. In the Summer of 2015 I joined Troy Web as an intern and was later hired as a part time employee. I am currently working with Troy Web both remotely from school and on location when available.</p>

        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>I work as both a Front-End Web Developer and UX Designer at Troy Web Consulting. My position within the company is incredibly flexible and has often led me to work in many different roles. I have designed and built websites, fronted research projects and even worked as a graphic designer at times.</p>

        <h4>Troy Web Consulting Rework</h4>
        <p>My Role: Designer/Developer</p>
        <p>One of my recent projects was to design and develop a new website for Troy Web Consulting with graphic designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-flood-38149590?authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=dWm0&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A323677393%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1456363344295%2Ctas%3Atyler%20fl">Tyler Flood</a>. In the prior months, Troy Web had undergone a massive rebranding project. The last step of  rebranding was to update the website. Instead of using a new coat of paint, we decided that building a new site from the ground up was the best option.</p>

        <div class="text-center"><img src="images/before.gif" width="250px" class="pad-right"><img src="images/logo.png" width="250"></div>
        <p class="pad-top">Before the rework, Troy Web Consultingâ€™s site was built using custom CSS. For the update, I implemented a Bootstrap framework and setup a Grunt-SCSS compiler for sustainability purposes. I also reworked the site map, simplified many of the UI elements and modernized the sight as a whole.

        <h4>Content Management Research Project</h4>
        <p>My Role: Project Lead</p>
        <p>One of the greatest challenges in the the clientele web industry is the issue of content management. How will you update a site once its built? Will it require a technical user? Or, will you implement a system which allows anyone to make content updates? These are questions which can completely alter the blueprint of a website.</p> 
        <p>As a custom web shop, Troy Web often builds sites that require a CMS. To help standardize Troy Webs process for CMS implementation, I led a research project to test the viability of various plugins, apps and systems. The goal of the project was to create a comprehensive breakdown of all possible CMSs and convey the strengths, weaknesses and usability of each.</p>
        <p>To test the viability of each CMS, I documented my experience while creating a multitude of mock websites. I also spent time analyzing the documentation of each CMS, while cross referencing my findings with other user cases. At the end of the project I gave a presentation on how various CMSs could improve the architecture and sustainability of customer websites.
