			<h4>Mustachio - Coming Soon</h4>
			<p>Since the dawn of time, men have grown beards and mustaches to serve many callings. Some men aspire to be Canadian Lumber Jacks. Some desire a strokable mustache as they quietly drink scotch next to a crackling fire. Others just want to stay warm in the winter. Regardless of reason, beards and mustaches are grown alike. However, is it not a shame you can’t track your mustaches glorious growth in a daily journal? Fret no longer my friend! Mustachio is here for you!</p>

			<p>Mustachio is a journal application that helps you track and document your beard/mustaches journey to maturity. Take pictures, give commentary and look back on your less bearded (less cool) self from two weeks ago!</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>Mustachio is a Swift iOS side project of my own creation. I’m the brains, the brawns, the Lead Designer, the Lead Developer and the Team Leader. In others words, its a solo project.</p>

			<h4>Mustachio Overview</h4>
			<p>A few months ago I became really interested in mobile application development. I had always been fascinated by the app store and wanted to try my hand at app development. Swift iOS seemed like a great entry point and I started teaching my self in my free time.</p>

			<p>Mustachio was initially a playground for me to learn Swift and explore it various capabilities. After a few weeks of tweaking and testing I decided Mustachio would be a great starter app to build. Currently, Mustachio is a ways from completion. I’m aiming to finish the app within the coming months and share it with the world. Lets be honest, who wouldn’t want to use a mustache centric app?</p>
