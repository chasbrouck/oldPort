			<h4>Shine</h4>
			<p>Shine is Puzzle/Horror game that takes place in the year 1960. Set in the Northern Reaches of New England, the main character searches for a missing friend after he receives a series of discomforting letters. Beginning as a friendly investigation you quickly become wrapped up in events much deeper and darker than initially anticipated. You are stranded in an isolated forest with only a lantern for light. You're Alone?</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>During Shines intimal development I served as the Lead Designer, Lead Writer, Co-Developer and Team Leader. I also wrote and recorded all music/sound in Shine.</p>

			<h4>Game Overview</h4>
			<p>Shine began as a school project developed over a 5-week period by myself, <a href="https://github.com/lucaskern">Lucas Kern</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Harrkass">Harrison Kass</a>. It is a point and click adventure built in C# that utilizes Microsoft Kinect. Before each level, the player is presented with a riddle which hints to a forthcoming puzzle solution. The player must than explore various environments, find clues and ultimately complete a puzzle to continue. The catch is, you are stranded in the dark. Using your hands, the player controls a lantern which illuminated a small section of the environment. This enables you to search for clues and interact with the scenery.</p>

			<p>Below is a demo play through of Shine after 5 weeks of development. The video shows our core "lantern feature" and also shows various puzzle elements we implemented.</p>

			<h4>Development Challenges</h4>
			<p>The greatest challenge associated with Shines development was the 5-week deadline our team had to meet. From the start, Shine had a very large scope and that weight often pressured us during development. To make sure we hit the deadline, our team often segmented off to work on individual tasks. We were spread very thin and communication was vital to make sure all "gears aligned properly". As Team Leader it was often my job to stimulate that communication.</p>

			<p>Another large hurdle of Shines development was the implementation of Microsoft Kinect and its SDK. Prior to this project neither my teammates or I had any experience developing with Kinect. We knew from the start that our Kinect environment had to be rock solid. It was the defining element of Shine and was necessary to make the game feel unique and enjoyable. We spent a great deal of time researching and had numerous failed iterations before we created a sound and structured Kinect environment.</p>

			<h4>Current Development</h4>
			<p>Shine began as a school project, but our team always had greater ambitions for the game. Due to class requirments, Shine was originaly built in Visual Studios WPF. Overall this was a poor environment to build a game in. Over the last few months, Lucas Kern and myself have been porting the game over to Unity. Once the port of "original content" is complete, we have plans to expand the game in length, scope and variety.</p>
